# cub3D

The goal of this project is to create a 3D game using RayCasting.  
  
This project uses the mlx library to display images. Images are `XPM` file (64 x 64).    

We using a `.ber` map to represent the mapin 3D. The `.ber` is only `1`, `0`, and `P` which respectively means `wall`, `nothing`, `player`.  
The map needs to be surronded by walls. If not, the program will return an error.
